//---------------//
Set up on ubuntu 20.04
//---------------//

1. install ruby 2.0 


2. install jekyll

$sudo apt-get install ruby ruby-dev make gcc nodejs ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev
$sudo gem install jekyll bundler


3. launch local website

$bundle install

$bundle exec jekyll serve
You can visit your website on : http://127.0.0.1:4000/

Edit _config.yml file that tells Jekyll some basics about your project.

After your edits, wait for a couple of seconds, refresh your browser for the changes. 


4. change font size of highlighted section 

Edit _sass/_syntax.scss, in the .highlight {} section, change the font-size 
I use type-size-5 for better visualization. 
The type-size-7 is the smallest supported font size. You can decrease the number
to increase the font size.

//---------------//
[1] about me:  check  ./_pages/about.md
[2] add a new tab (i.e., research) 
edit _config.yml, 
go to ./_data, add navigation.yml to add "research" section
go to ./_pages, copy non-menu-page.md to research.md, modify it

I am adding research as single layout, no archive. Hence, no neede to have 
./_research folder for different posts.

In this way, I can directly edit _pages/research.md.

for editing the contents, please refer to _pages/archive-layout-with-content.md. 

[3] edit content of a tab
go to _pages/<tab-topic>.md, modify script
