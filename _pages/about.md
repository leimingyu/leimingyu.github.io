I am currently working full-time as Imaging Engineer at [Analogic](https://www.analogic.com/).


I received my Ph.D from Northeastern University.
I performed doctoral research in the Northeastern University Computer Architecture Research Lab ([NUCAR](https://ece.northeastern.edu/groups/nucar/research.html)),
one of the top laboratories in the United States conducting research in the field of computer architecture.
[Dr. David Kaeli](https://ece.northeastern.edu/fac-ece/kaeli.html) is my research advisor.
I was also mentored by [Dr. Qianqian Fang](http://fanglab.org/people/index.html), director of Computational Optics and Translation Imaging Lab (COTI Lab).
