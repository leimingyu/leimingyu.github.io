With more than a decade of expertise in General Purpose Computing on Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs), I have cultivated a passion for enhancing the performance of complex algorithms across a diverse range of platforms, from embedded systems to workstations and high-performance computing clusters. My academic and professional journey has endowed me with a profound understanding of computer architecture, alongside a robust foundation in machine learning, deep learning, and medical imaging.

I am particularly enthusiastic about exploring the intricacies of GPU design, including both the software and hardware aspects, as well as driving forward the development of new features. Presently, I am engaged in pioneering GPU-related research within the esteemed Graphics Research Team at Qualcomm, where I continue to contribute to the cutting edge of technology innovation.


I received my Ph.D from Northeastern University.
I performed doctoral research in the Northeastern University Computer Architecture Research Lab ([NUCAR](https://ece.northeastern.edu/groups/nucar/research.html)),
one of the top laboratories in the United States conducting research in the field of computer architecture.
[Dr. David Kaeli](https://ece.northeastern.edu/fac-ece/kaeli.html) is my research advisor.
I was also mentored by [Dr. Qianqian Fang](http://fanglab.org/people/index.html), director of Computational Optics and Translational Imaging Lab (COTI Lab).
