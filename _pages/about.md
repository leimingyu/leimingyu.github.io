I am an expert in General Purpose Computing on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs).
I enjoyed accelerating complex algorithms on modern accelerators.
I have a background in computer architecture, machine learning, deep learning, and medical imaging.
I am enthusiastic about the software and hardware stacks of GPU design and its feature development.

I received my Ph.D from Northeastern University.
I performed doctoral research in the Northeastern University Computer Architecture Research Lab ([NUCAR](https://ece.northeastern.edu/groups/nucar/research.html)),
one of the top laboratories in the United States conducting research in the field of computer architecture.
[Dr. David Kaeli](https://ece.northeastern.edu/fac-ece/kaeli.html) is my research advisor.
I was also mentored by [Dr. Qianqian Fang](http://fanglab.org/people/index.html), director of Computational Optics and Translational Imaging Lab (COTI Lab).
