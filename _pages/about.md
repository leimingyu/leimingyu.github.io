Iâ€™m passionate about parallel computing.
I am an expert in accelerating complex algorithms on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs).
I have knowledge in computer architecture, machine learning, deep learning and medical imaging.
I am interested in growing my knowledge in software and hardware stacks on GPU design and development.

I received my Ph.D from Northeastern University.
I performed doctoral research in the Northeastern University Computer Architecture Research Lab ([NUCAR](https://ece.northeastern.edu/groups/nucar/research.html)),
one of the top laboratories in the United States conducting research in the field of computer architecture.
[Dr. David Kaeli](https://ece.northeastern.edu/fac-ece/kaeli.html) is my research advisor.
I was also mentored by [Dr. Qianqian Fang](http://fanglab.org/people/index.html), director of Computational Optics and Translational Imaging Lab (COTI Lab).
