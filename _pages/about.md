I graduated from Northeastern University in May 2019.
During Ph.D period, I worked in the Northeastern University Computer Architecture Research Lab ([NUCAR](https://ece.northeastern.edu/groups/nucar/research.html)),
one of the top laboratories in the United States conducting research in the field of computer architecture.
[Dr. David Kaeli](https://ece.northeastern.edu/fac-ece/kaeli.html) is my research advisor.
I am also mentored by [Dr. Qianqian Fang](http://fanglab.org/people/index.html) on the MCX project.
I am currently working full-time as Imaging Engineer at [Analogic](https://www.analogic.com/).
