After you committed your repo, github will automatically detect the programming
language you used. Sometimes, the specified the language is not the right one.

You can add a .gitattributes file in the top folder of the repo directory.

Example of gitattributes file
======
Ignore all the files except the ".cu" files.
```bash
* linguist-vendored
*.cu linguist-vendored=false

```
