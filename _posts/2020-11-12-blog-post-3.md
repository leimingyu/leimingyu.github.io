Burn a new OS image onto a bootable flash drive.

First, download the iso image for your targeted OS.

Get your flash drive standby.

I use the **dd** command to burn the iso image onto a flash drive.
Here, I am using Fedora 20 as my native OS to create a bootable flash drive.
However, the steps should be quite similar on other Operating Systems.

You can following the documentation [here](https://leimingyu.github.io/files/linux/Create-BootableFlashDrive-Fedora20.pdf).
