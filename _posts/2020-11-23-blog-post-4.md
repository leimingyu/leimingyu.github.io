**screen** command in Linux provides the ability to launch and use multiple shell 
sessions from a single ssh session. 

When you ssh connection is broken, the previous screen session continues to run 
on the remote machine. You won't loose your work!


**Install screen**
======

On Ubuntu
```bash
$sudo apt-get install screen
```

On CentOS/Fedora
```bash
$sudo yum install screen
```


**Common Commands**
======

```bash
# list active sessions
$screen -ls

# create a new session
$screen -S <name>

# detach current working session
on your keyboard, press ctrl + a, then press d 

# resume an active session (if # of sessions > 1)
$screen -r <name>

# resume an active session (if the session is shown attached)
$screen -d -r <name>

# check the session name when you are using a screen session 
$echo $STY

# resume an active session (if # of sessions == 1)
$screen -x

# terminate current session 
type exit in the terminal

```
