"Chat with RTX" is an application that allows customization of a GPT large language model (LLM) with your specific content like documents and notes.
This enables you to generate contextually relevant answers from a bespoke chatbot.
The entire setup operates locally on RTX-enabled Windows PCs or workstations, ensuring quick and secure access to information.

I have an RTX 4060Ti and Windows 11 desktop. Below shows the steps to set it up.

### Requirement
* GPU	NVIDIA GeForce™ RTX 30 or 40 Series GPU or NVIDIA RTX™ Ampere or Ada Generation GPU with at least 8GB of VRAM
* RAM	16GB or greater
* OS	Windows 11
* Driver	535.11 or later
* File Size	35 GB
