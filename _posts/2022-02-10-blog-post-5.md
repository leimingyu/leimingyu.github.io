**miniconda** is a simplified version of **anaconda** where you can configure
different environments for various development purposes.
Using this software, Tensorflow with GPU support can be set up for deep learning research.

In this tutorial,[2022-rehl8-miniconda-tfgpu.pdf](https://leimingyu.github.io/files/deeplearning/2022-rehl8-miniconda-tfgpu.pdf), I go over the following steps to set miniconda and tensorflow-gpu (v2.7.0) on RHEL 8.
- Uninstall existing anaconda
- Install miniconda for multi-users 
- Install tensorflow-gpu with pip
