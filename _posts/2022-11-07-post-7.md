Remote jupyter notebook can be useful when the remote computer has better computing power than the local one or the remote is a server that you can connect from different places.


### Prepare
* First, you need to have openssh server installed on the remote machine.
* You will need to generate public key authentication on our local machine. 
* In the remote machine, copy the content of id_rsa.pub to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
([reference link](https://kb.iu.edu/d/aews))
* Test ssh without typing the password 
```
$ssh <username>@<remoteIP>
```
* In the remote machine, install anaconda or miniconda
* Create a deeplearning env (optional) using conda
* Activate deeplearning env, and install jupyter notebook
([reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58068818/how-to-use-jupyter-notebooks-in-a-conda-environment))
* Configure Jupyter to use Python kernel
```
ipython kernel install --user --name=deeplearning
```
* In the remote machine, add PATH for jupyter notebook in ~/.bashrc file.
I am using the path in miniconda.
```
export PATH="/home/leiming/miniconda3/envs/deeplearning/bin:$PATH"
```

### Test 
* Now, from your local machine, you can ssh to remote.

* Start jupyter notebook via port 8889 in the remote machine. (Do not close the current terminal!)
```
jupyter notebook --no-browser --port 8889
```

* Start a new terminal in your local terminal
```
ssh -N -L localhost:8899:localhost:8889 <username>@<remoteIP>
```

* Copy the localhost link (from the remote machine terminal)
to your browser in your local machine
```
http://localhost:8889/?token=dd5ac17bc80e068ece002ea35ccf867547030cfa0328
```

* Now, you should see your brower has a jupyter notebook with the default deeplearning conda env.
