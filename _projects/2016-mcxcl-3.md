The Monte Carlo (MC) method has been widely regarded as the gold-standard for modeling light propagation inside complex random media, such as human tissues. It, however, suffers from low computational efficiency because a large number of photons have to be simulated to achieve desired solution quality with low stochastic noise. Sequential MC simulation implementations require extensive computation and long run-time, typically ranging from several hours to several days.

In this work, we use Open Computing Language (OpenCL) to leverage the computing power of GPUs. We analyze the characteristics of MCXCL kernel and develop several optimization schemes to improve the execution efficiency such as branch divergence. Previous static workload distribution scheme at the thread-level has been improved by the dynamic scheme at the work-group level. The workload balancing issue, when marshaling simulation among various GPU devices, is addressed by the proposed throughput model.
